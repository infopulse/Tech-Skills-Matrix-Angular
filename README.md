# Tech Skills Matrix

Skills matrix to evaluate **tech** skills of Angular engineers.  
Soft skills are important as well, but they are not included in this matrix.

## How to use?

You are welcome to use this matrix as reference in your
There are 2 options to use this matrix:

1. Open in GitHub pages (recommended): https://infopulse.github.io/Tech-Skills-Matrix-Angular
2. Check out every skill category in markdown files: (will be updated)
   - [RxJS Basics](matrix/01.md)
   - [Angular Basics](matrix/02.md)
   - [Angular](matrix/03.md)
   - [Testing Angular Apps](matrix/04.md)

- Review required skills for each level and category
- Give yourself honest feedback if you know well enough each skill (In future releases we will provide a self-assessment tool)

We encourage you to use this matrix in your companies to align the skills and knowledge of Angular engineers worldwide.

## Rules

As a company we expect that:

1. every Angular Engineer who claims a specific seniority level must have at least 7 basic skill categories not less than this level
2. every next seniority level includes skills and knowledge of all previous levels
3. tech skills are generalized to apply to a wide range of engineers
4. the matrix is used both for internal Angular engineers and for [hiring purposes](https://www.infopulse.com/join-us?specialization=6)

## Roadmap

It is good to measure the skills using the matrix, but it is even better to have a guide on how to improve the skills
and gain new knowledge.

- [The roadmap](roadmap/roadmap.md) _⚠️ Currently under development_
- Checkout this roadmap as possible reference: https://roadmap.sh/angular

You are welcome to:

- leave your comments and suggestions in [Issues](https://github.com/infopulse/Tech-Skills-Matrix-Angular/issues)

  Or create a pull-request!

## Matrix maintenance plan

- We plan to review and update the matrix regularly, including the review of PR and issues
- We plan to add a self-assessment tool to the matrix
- We plan to add a roadmap for Angular engineers
